# ggdocumentation
An R package allowing users to add documentation (sponsor logo, author name, date, data source) to 'ggplot2' plots. It implements Edward Tufte's Principles of Analytical Design principle #5: Documentation (from Tufte's book "Beautiful Evidence"). It also supports integrating the 'ggthemes' package.
